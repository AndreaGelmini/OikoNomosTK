A comprehensive PHP Toolkit for financial mathematics, micro/macroeconomic calculations, financial analysis, and forecasting.

OikoNomosTK aims to provide a robust and well-tested set of tools for developers needing to implement common formulas and models from finance and economics within their PHP applications.

## Key Features

* **Financial Mathematics:** Simple/Compound Interest, Annuities, Amortization Schedules (French, Italian, etc.), NPV, IRR, Bond Pricing basics.
* **Financial Statement Analysis:** Key Ratios (ROE, ROI, Liquidity, Leverage, Efficiency).
* **Investment & Portfolio:** Risk/Return calculations, CAPM, Performance Metrics (Sharpe, Treynor).
* **Microeconomics:** Consumer Theory (Utility, MRS), Producer Theory (Production Functions, Costs, MRTS), Market Structures (Perfect Competition, Monopoly profit maximization).
* **Macroeconomics:** National Accounts (GDP), IS-LM basics, AD-AS basics, Inflation, Growth Models (Solow basics).
* **Forecasting:** Moving Averages, Basic Exponential Smoothing, Simple Linear Regression.
* **Taxation:** Generic calculations for VAT, simple income tax. *(Note: Taxation is country-specific, this library provides general formulas)*.
* Built with precision in mind (recommends using BCMath).

## Installation

The recommended way to install OikoNomosTK is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require oikonomos-tk/oikonomos-tk
```
## Basic Usage
```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use OikoNomosTK\Finance\Basic\CompoundInterest;
use OikoNomosTK\Finance\Corporate\FinancialRatios;
use OikoNomosTK\Finance\InvestmentAppraisal; // Assuming NPV is here

// Example 1: Calculate Future Value (Compound Interest)
$principal = 1000;  // e.g., â‚¬1000
$annualRate = 0.05; // 5% annual rate
$years = 10;
// Ensure BCMath is enabled or use a library that handles precision
bcscale(10); // Set precision for BCMath

$futureValue = CompoundInterest::calculateFutureValue((string)$principal, (string)$annualRate, $years);
echo "Future Value: " . $futureValue . "\n"; // Output: Future Value: 1628.894627

// Example 2: Calculate ROE (Return on Equity)
$netIncome = '150000'; // From Income Statement
$shareholdersEquity = '1000000'; // From Balance Sheet

$roe = FinancialRatios::calculateROE($netIncome, $shareholdersEquity);
echo "ROE: " . bcmul($roe, '100', 2) . "%\n"; // Output: ROE: 15.00%

// Example 3: Calculate Net Present Value (NPV)
$initialInvestment = '-100000'; // Initial outflow
$cashFlows = ['30000', '40000', '50000', '60000']; // Cash flows for years 1-4
$discountRate = '0.10'; // 10% discount rate

$npv = InvestmentAppraisal::calculateNPV($initialInvestment, $cashFlows, $discountRate);
echo "NPV: " . $npv . "\n";

?>
```
*(Note: Examples assume usage of BCMath for precision, adjust according to your implementation).*
